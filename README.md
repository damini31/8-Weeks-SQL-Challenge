<head><h1># Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner</h1>
<body>
<h3><a href : "[https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/]">Here's the challenge</a></h3>
<p>Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
<ul>
<li>sales</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>members</li>
</ul>
You can inspect the entity relationship diagram</p>

<h3>1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</h3></br>
select 
</br>s.customer_id,

</br>from sales s
</br>LEFT JOIN menu m on s.product_id = m.product_id

<h3>2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</h3>
</br>select
